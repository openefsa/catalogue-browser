1;if a hierarchy is selected as base term (describe function);Warning: using a hierarchy as a base term is too general, could you be more precise?;LOW;LOW
2;if a non-hierarchy is selected as base term (describe function);Base term successfully added;NONE;NONE
3;if a forbidden process is chosen (the derivative should be used);Risk: don't apply a process to a raw commodity! Use the existing derivative instead.;HIGH;HIGH
4;if a derivative is described with a process facet with an ordCode value less than the implicit ordCode;Risk: process applied in the wrong order!;HIGH;HIGH
5;if an ambiguous term is selected (terms reported in the BR_Exceptions);Warning: an ambiguous term has been selected, choose a more specific one!;LOW;LOW
6;if more than one process with the same ordCode is chosen (mutually exclusive property violated);Risk: these processes cannot be used together!;HIGH;HIGH
7;if a base term which does not belong to reporting or exposure hierarchy is selected;Warning: don't use a non reportable term!;LOW;LOW
8;if a non exposure hierarchy-term (blue pyramid) is selected as base term (describe);Warning: a non-exposure hierarchy term has been selected!;LOW;LOW
9;if an aspecific term is selected (describe);Warning: a non-specific term has been selected! Please choose a more precise one.;NONE;LOW
10;if the generic facet Processed (or children) is selected;Warning: a generic process facet has been selected! Please choose a more precise one.;LOW;LOW
11;if an ingredient is selected for raw commodity or derivative;Warning: is it a minor ingredient? Please check!;LOW;LOW
12;if a single Source Commodity is selected for raw commodity;Risk: for mixed raw commodities only multiple explicit source commodities are allowed!;HIGH;HIGH
13;if a source is selected for mixed derivative (having more than one F27.);Risk: source facet not allowed in mixed derivatives!;HIGH;HIGH
14;if a source is selected for derivative with only one F27.;Warning: make sure that source is used for better specifying the raw source otherwise is forbidden.;LOW;LOW
15;if a base term not valid in the exposure hierarchy is chosen;Risk: the term is not valid for human exposure calculation!;NONE;HIGH
16;if a source is selected for composite (c or s);Risk: source not applicable to composite food!;HIGH;HIGH
17;if a source commodity is selected for composite (c or s);Risk: source commodity not applicable to composite food!;HIGH;HIGH
18;if two processes (implicit or explicit) with decimal ordcode and same integer part are applied (at least one explicit);Risk: use the existing derivative instead of adding the facet!;HIGH;HIGH
19;if one or more source commodities are added to a derivative already having an implicit source commodity (not parent of the added);Risk: use the generic derivative as base term for describing a mixed derivative!;HIGH;HIGH
20;if a source is selected for a generic derivative without F27 (neither explicit nor implicit);Risk: it's forbidden to use the source without the (single) source commodity!;HIGH;HIGH
21;if wrong term structure or term not found;Error: code not well structured!;ERROR;ERROR
22;if reconstitution is added as process to concentrate, powder or other dehydrated terms;Risk: select the reconstituted version of the product instead!;HIGH;HIGH
23;if the facet group id doesn't exists;Error: the facet group id has not been found!;ERROR;ERROR
24;if the facet doesn't belong to the group hierarchy;Error: the facet has not been found under the specified group id!;ERROR;ERROR
